# Exploring Code, Culture & Beyond

Welcome to my digital space where curiosity drives discovery! I'm passionate about unraveling complex algorithms and exploring diverse cultures around the world. Whether I'm diving deep into machine learning research or wandering through cobblestone streets in a new city, I love sharing the insights and stories from both journeys.

## What Drives Me
Technology and travel might seem worlds apart, but they're both about **exploration**, **problem-solving**, and **connecting with something bigger than yourself**. Through code, I solve problems and build systems that make a difference. Through travel, I discover new perspectives and connect with people from all walks of life.
