As the global shift toward renewable energy accelerates, **accurate wind power forecasting** has become increasingly essential for grid reliability and efficient resource planning. Wind is a naturally fluctuating source of energy, and its power generation depends on multiple environmental factors like wind speed, direction, and atmospheric conditions.

In this blog series, we'll walk through the development of a complete machine learning pipeline using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks—a type of recurrent neural network particularly well-suited for time series forecasting. By the end of this series, you'll understand how to clean and prepare real-world wind turbine data, build and train an LSTM model, evaluate its performance, and explore ways to make the model production-ready.

In this first chapter, we'll cover the following:

- Project goals and structure
- Environment setup and tools
- Key Python libraries used
- A quick preview of the dataset and outputs

Let's dive in.

## 🗂️ Project Overview

This project, available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/vipulatippa/wind-power-forecast-lstm), focuses on **forecasting power output from wind turbines** based on past measurements of wind speed, wind direction, and other features. The goal is to predict future power values using sequential input features—an ideal use case for LSTMs.

### 🔧 Repository Structure

Here's what you'll find in the GitHub repository:

```
wind-power-forecast-lstm/
│
├── test.py                    # Main Jupyter notebook
├── T1.csv                     # Raw input dataset
├── 3 Figures                  # Output
├── README.md                  # Project overview and usage
└── Wind_power_lstm_model.h5   # Trained model file
```

This structure keeps things simple. The core logic is implemented in the Jupyter notebook, making it easy to understand and modify. The dataset (T1.csv) contains the wind turbine data you'll work with.

## ⚙️ Setting Up the Environment

To ensure reproducibility, the first step is to set up a Python environment with all necessary packages.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vipulatippa/wind-power-forecast-lstm.git
cd wind-power-forecast-lstm
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then install libraries such as TensorFlow, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn—tools that form the backbone of your machine learning workflow.

## 🧰 Key Python Libraries Used

Let's briefly introduce the libraries used in this project and their roles:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
```

**Library Breakdown:**

- **pandas**: For loading and manipulating tabular data
- **numpy**: For efficient numerical operations
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: For visualizing data trends and correlations
- **scikit-learn**: Used for preprocessing like scaling and metrics evaluation
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: The deep learning framework used to build and train the LSTM model

Together, these tools allow us to handle the full ML pipeline: from loading and cleaning data to building, training, and evaluating a neural network.

## 🌬️ The Forecasting Problem

Before diving into the code, it's helpful to understand the task at hand. A wind turbine generates power based on various physical parameters. However, the relationship between these variables—especially **wind speed** and **power output**—is nonlinear and varies over time.

Because the data has a strong **temporal component**, using traditional regression models may not be effective. That's where **LSTM models** come in. LSTMs can learn long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them excellent for forecasting problems like ours.

### Dataset Features

The dataset includes:

- **Timestamps** (date/time)
- **Wind speed**
- **Wind direction** 
- **Power output**
- **Possibly other engineered features** (we'll explore this in the next chapter)

## 📊 A Quick Data Peek

Let's preview what the raw data looks like. This will help us verify that the file is loaded correctly and contains the expected columns.

```python
df = pd.read_csv('datasets/wind_dataset.csv')
print(df.head())
```

Assuming the dataset includes a date column, we should parse it as a datetime object and set it as the index for time series analysis:

```python
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
df.set_index('date', inplace=True)
```

## 🧠 Why Use LSTM?

This project specifically uses **LSTM** rather than a regular neural network or traditional regression model. Here's why:

### Key Advantages:

- **Temporal dependencies**: Power output at any given time depends heavily on recent wind conditions
- **Lagging effects**: Wind speed might impact power generation a few moments later—not instantaneously
- **Noise smoothing**: LSTMs are more robust to minor fluctuations in sequential data
- **Memory cells**: Can retain important information over long sequences

We'll dive into the actual model architecture in further chapters, but for now, it's enough to know that LSTM networks are purpose-built for time series like this.

## 📌 What You'll Learn in This Series

By following along, you'll learn to:

✅ **Clean and explore** raw wind turbine data  
✅ **Engineer relevant** time-based features  
✅ **Build an LSTM model** in Keras  
✅ **Evaluate and visualize** model performance  
✅ **Optionally deploy** the model for real-time use

## ✅ Summary

In this first chapter, we:

- ✅ Introduced the goal of forecasting wind turbine power using LSTM
- ✅ Explained the tools and structure of the GitHub repository
- ✅ Set up the Python environment and dependencies
- ✅ Briefly previewed the dataset and the problem we're trying to solve

With everything installed and set up, you're now ready to explore the data in more depth.

## ⏭️ Coming Up Next: From Raw Data to Predictive Power

We'll roll up our sleeves and dive into the **preprocessing and feature engineering** steps that make or break time series models. You'll learn how to convert raw timestamped data into a structured, machine-readable format, extract meaningful time-based features, and create lag features that give our LSTM model the historical context it needs to make accurate predictions.

These steps form the backbone of our forecasting pipeline—and set the stage for building a truly effective model.
